* TODO =call-with-database=, etc. in an sqlite3-utils egg?
  or too trivial? =column-names=, =column-types=, etc. seems useful.
* TODO foreign keys
  we'll just construct an enumeration, basically; and pass off the
  parser. oh, but we have a foreign-foreign key; one that comes from
  far away: namely the accessioning database. nothing to be done
  there; unless we want to ajax, for instance, the ids.

  hmm; what generic mechanism could we come up with to do this?

* TODO database objects
  should be controllable by database objects that house unserializable
  metadata (enums, keys, etc.)

  the database object instantiates the CRUD AJAX and configuration
  JSON given certain tables; who's responsible for whitelisting?

  a liberal hook architecture, in which the caller provides hooks for
  table whitelisting or (optionally) a list of tables; could provide
  create, read, update, delete hooks (with appropriate data); such
  that i could, for instance, add users, delete users (or not), change
  user's name (or not), cache reports(which would require a database
  connection, by the way; or else: given a chance to modify the data
  before it's stored! or even bail out with an error! create the
  report, for instance; modify the storage field; or 500 on
  error). that's good!

  (damn; have to be away from home to get the Wanderlust of
  ideas. extra-domiciliate; undomesticate)

  (One has to withdraw from home (be extra-domiciliated, so to speak),
  to reachieve the Wanderlust of thought: that font of violent
  ex-nihilo.)

  =write-grid-to-table= actually handles the `RUD' of CRUD;
  =read-grid-from-table= the `C'.

  there appear to be somewhat clearcut points for abstraction, too; at
  least for reading. table is hard-coded, though; and has to be
  gleaned from the query, i think;

  though we can configure it with database objects, has to flexible
  enough to pivot on tables; therefore, metadata, for instance, has to
  be a nested map: table -> field -> metadata.
* TODO specifize
  ad-hoc sqlite3, jqGrid implementation.
* TODO generalize
  to couchdb, say, or yui datatable.
* TODO config also spawns a server
  and should take, for instance, a table parameter.
