* TODO constraints to adding data
  what about NOT NULL, foreign-keys, etc.; should we refuse to
  add/update given these constraints? must enforce them ourselves, i
  think. or: sqlite3 has these update triggers, etc.

  there are currently 64533 RNAIDs, by the way; fetching them
  foreignly for every addition won't work, i think. can we fetch it
  once at the beginning?
* TODO minimum subset of options
  allow the user to pass in additionals: pager, say; dialog box language?
* TODO search
* TODO caption
  provide a format-string for the table
* TODO the preview button is ad-hoc, by the way
  need to come up with a generic mechanism for this? no. it can simply
  be handled by the application, which makes its own mutations on the
  datagrid. we merely supply the configuration, getters and setters.

  hmm; but the pager is ad-hoc, too; we'll have to provide that, as
  well. or can we assume: =#table=, =#pager=? no.

  should, therefore, ship with a minimal, default example; which can
  be extemporized upon.
* TODO =call-with-database=, etc. in an sqlite3-utils egg?
  or too trivial? =column-names=, =column-types=, etc. seems useful.
* DONE foreign keys
  CLOSED: [2010-07-03 Sat 23:38]
  we'll just construct an enumeration, basically; and pass off the
  parser. oh, but we have a foreign-foreign key; one that comes from
  far away: namely the accessioning database. nothing to be done
  there; unless we want to ajax, for instance, the ids.

  hmm; what generic mechanism could we come up with to do this?

  also: should the foreign keys be able to reference not only a
  foreign table, but a foreign table from a foreign database? in that
  case, we'll have to pass not the connection; but the database
  itself, such that we can make a subsidiary connection.

  for efficiency's sake, let's just pass the connection (confining
  foreign keys to tables of the same database); if there's an actual
  need, we can pass the whole database object and make connections to
  a foreign database.

  should be controllable by database objects that house unserializable
  metadata (enums, keys, etc.)

  the database object instantiates the CRUD AJAX and configuration
  JSON given certain tables; who's responsible for whitelisting?

  a liberal hook architecture, in which the caller provides hooks for
  table whitelisting or (optionally) a list of tables; could provide
  create, read, update, delete hooks (with appropriate data); such
  that i could, for instance, add users, delete users (or not), change
  user's name (or not), cache reports(which would require a database
  connection, by the way; or else: given a chance to modify the data
  before it's stored! or even bail out with an error! create the
  report, for instance; modify the storage field; or 500 on
  error). that's good!

  (damn; have to be away from home to get the Wanderlust of
  ideas. extra-domiciliate; undomesticate)

  (One has to withdraw from home (be extra-domiciliated, so to speak),
  to reachieve the Wanderlust of thought: that font of violent
  ex-nihilo.)

  =write-grid-to-table= actually handles the `RUD' of CRUD;
  =read-grid-from-table= the `C'.

  there appear to be somewhat clearcut points for abstraction, too; at
  least for reading. table is hard-coded, though; and has to be
  gleaned from the query, i think;

  though we can configure it with database objects, has to flexible
  enough to pivot on tables; therefore, metadata, for instance, has to
  be a nested map: table -> field -> metadata.
